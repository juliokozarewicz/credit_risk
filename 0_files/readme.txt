Credit risk can be defined as the risk that a debtor will not settle its commitments in a timely manner, also called default. In fact, every type of financial investment has its risks. Among them, credit risk is one of those that can generate the greatest problems for investors and cause severe losses. So, technically, credit risk is related to the ability of a borrower to return that amount, under the agreed conditions, to the creditor. It is a practice aimed not only at mitigating financial inconvenience, but also at providing a structure to deal with the situation.

One way to assess risk is through rating, which in turn is a specific methodology developed by risk rating agencies. Standard & Poors, Moody's and Fitch Ratings are some of the best known. Institutions assess issues such as type of business, economic scenario and relationship of partnerships to categorize risk. The companies evaluated by the agencies are classified into:

Level A (AAA, AA+, A1, A2, Aa): low risk of default
Level B (BBB, BB+, B1, B2, Bb): average default risk
Level C and variations: high risk of default
Level D: in default situation.
